# Sandbox Testing Guidelines

This document outlines the principles for creating isolated feature tests within the `/feature-test` directory. Adhering to these guidelines is crucial for maintaining a stable and predictable development environment.

## Core Principles

The primary goal of this architecture is to **isolate** and **stabilize** feature development and bug fixing, preventing regressions and side-effects in the main application.

### 1. Absolute Isolation
- **No Dependencies on Main App Pages**: A test sandbox (e.g., `rotation-test.tsx`) **must not** import any components or hooks from complex application pages like `/edit-pdf-new`.
- **Use Stable Modules Only**: Sandboxes should only import from stable, shared locations like `@/components/ui/*` and `@/lib/*`.
- **Self-Contained Logic**: All logic required to demonstrate or fix the feature should be contained within the test component itself or imported from `@/lib`. All data should be mocked.
- **Use the `SandboxLayout`**: To ensure a consistent testing UI, all new sandboxes should use the `SandboxLayout` component as their root container.

### 2. High-Fidelity Simulation
- **Simulate Real Constraints**: The sandbox must accurately simulate the constraints of the production environment. For example, if testing a component that interacts with a read-only object from an external library, the sandbox must also treat that object as read-only. This is the only way to prevent "it works in the sandbox, but fails in production" errors.

### 3. When to Use a Sandbox (Error Triage)

The sandbox is a powerful tool, but it is not necessary for every change. It addresses the problem of **over-engineering** by being reserved for "major surgery."

| Error Type                                  | Sandbox Required? | Explanation                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | :---------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üß© **UI/Layout Errors**                       |        ‚ùå         | (e.g., Button alignment, color issues, padding). These are low-risk and can be addressed in the component directly. |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Simple State Synchronization**           |        ‚ö†Ô∏è         | (e.g., A form input not updating its preview). Optional. Use a sandbox only if the logic is unusually complex.    |
| üí• **Destructive or Structural Changes**      |        ‚úÖ         | **(e.g., Page rotation, re-ordering, deletion, complex state logic changes in hooks).** **MUST** be sandboxed. |

### 4. How to Add a New Test

To reduce the cost of creating a sandbox, follow this streamlined process:

1.  **Create the Component File**: Create your new test file, e.g., `src/app/feature-test/[feature]/my-new-feature-test.tsx`. Make it a `"use client"` component.
2.  **Use the Template**: Use the `SandboxLayout` component to structure your test. Focus only on the logic and minimal UI needed to reproduce the issue.
    ```tsx
    "use client";
    import React from 'react';
    import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

    export default function MyNewFeatureTest() {
      // Your test logic here
      return (
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Test Area</h3>
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            Component-specific test UI goes here.
          </p>
          <Button>Test Button</Button>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
3.  **Register the Test**: Open `src/app/feature-test/[feature]/featureMap.ts` and add an entry for your new test. Use a URL-friendly key (kebab-case).
    ```typescript
    // src/app/feature-test/[feature]/featureMap.ts
    import { lazy } from 'react';

    export const featureMap = {
      // ... existing tests
      'my-new-feature': {
        name: 'My New Feature',
        description: 'An isolated test for my awesome new feature.',
        component: lazy(() => import('./my-new-feature-test')),
      },
    };
    ```
4.  **Test**: Navigate to `/feature-test/my-new-feature` to see your component in action.
